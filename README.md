# @pseudolym Listed theme
Custom Listed theme, as used on https://listed.to/@pseudolym. Partly adapted from the [Listed documentation](https://standardnotes.com/help/66/how-do-i-change-the-colors-fonts-and-general-layout-of-my-listed-blog). Colouring of `monospace fonts`/`code blocks` still a W.I.P.

Contains code for first-line indents (line 71), which may not be particularly efficient considering I have to add inline CSS to negate it, via `<p>` tags, to the main doc whenever I don't want them/publish poetry. Delete lines 69â€“73 to remove the indents. I'm open to hearing better solutions to this issue.

CSS broken? Have accessibility concerns? Feel free to contact me through Github, the blog, or any other personal avenue.

Thank you [Listed](https://listed.to) for providing a terrific platform.
